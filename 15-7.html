        <h3>以下資訊來自 mozilla MDN Web document：</h3>
        <p>
          A
          <strong><code>WeakRef</code></strong>
          object lets you hold a weak reference to another object, without preventing that object
          from getting garbage-collected.
        </p>
        <h3>Description 描述</h3>
        <p>
          A
          <code>WeakRef</code>
          object contains a weak reference to an object, which is called its
          <em>target</em>
          or
          <em>referent</em>
          . A
          <em>weak reference</em>
          to an object is a reference that does not prevent the object from being reclaimed by the
          garbage collector. In contrast, a normal (or
          <em>strong</em>
          ) reference keeps an object in memory. When an object no longer has any strong references
          to it, the JavaScript engine's garbage collector may destroy the object and reclaim its
          memory. If that happens, you can't get the object from a weak reference anymore.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Because non-registered symbols are also garbage collectable, they can also be used as the
          target of a
          <code>WeakRef</code>
          object. However, the use case of this is limited.
        </p>
        <h3>Avoid where possible 盡量避免使用</h3>
        <p>
          Correct use of
          <code>WeakRef</code>
          takes careful thought, and it's best avoided if possible. It's also important to avoid
          relying on any specific behaviors not guaranteed by the specification. When, how, and
          whether garbage collection occurs is down to the implementation of any given JavaScript
          engine. Any behavior you observe in one engine may be different in another engine, in
          another version of the same engine, or even in a slightly different situation with the
          same version of the same engine. Garbage collection is a hard problem that JavaScript
          engine implementers are constantly refining and improving their solutions to.
        </p>

          Here are some specific points included by the authors in the proposal that introduced
          <code>WeakRef</code>
          :

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Garbage collectors are complicated. If an application or library depends on GC cleaning
            up a WeakRef or calling a finalizer [cleanup callback] in a timely, predictable manner,
            it's likely to be disappointed: the cleanup may happen much later than expected, or not
            at all. Sources of variability include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              One object might be garbage-collected much sooner than another object, even if they
              become unreachable at the same time, e.g., due to generational collection.
            </li>
            <li>
              Garbage collection work can be split up over time using incremental and concurrent
              techniques.
            </li>
            <li>Various runtime heuristics can be used to balance memory usage, responsiveness.</li>
            <li>
              The JavaScript engine may hold references to things which look like they are
              unreachable (e.g., in closures, or inline caches).
            </li>
            <li>
              Different JavaScript engines may do these things differently, or the same engine may
              change its algorithms across versions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Complex factors may lead to objects being held alive for unexpected amounts of time,
              such as use with certain APIs.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Notes on WeakRefs 使用說明</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            If your code has just created a
            <code>WeakRef</code>
            for a target object, or has gotten a target object from a
            <code>WeakRef</code>
            's
            <code>deref</code>
            method, that target object will not be reclaimed until the end of the current JavaScript
            job (including any promise reaction jobs that run at the end of a script job). That is,
            you can only "see" an object get reclaimed between turns of the event loop. This is
            primarily to avoid making the behavior of any given JavaScript engine's garbage
            collector apparent in code — because if it were, people would write code relying on that
            behavior, which would break when the garbage collector's behavior changed. (Garbage
            collection is a hard problem; JavaScript engine implementers are constantly refining and
            improving how it works.)
          </li>
          <li>
            If multiple
            <code>WeakRef</code>
            s have the same target, they're consistent with one another. The result of calling
            <code>deref</code>
            on one of them will match the result of calling
            <code>deref</code>
            on another of them (in the same job), you won't get the target object from one of them
            but
            <code>undefined</code>
            from another.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the target of a
            <code>WeakRef</code>
            is also in a
            <a href="15-8.html"><code>FinalizationRegistry</code></a>
            , the
            <code>WeakRef</code>
            's target is cleared at the same time or before any cleanup callback associated with the
            registry is called; if your cleanup callback calls
            <code>deref</code>
            on a
            <code>WeakRef</code>
            for the object, it will receive
            <code>undefined</code>
            .
          </li>
          <li>
            You cannot change the target of a
            <code>WeakRef</code>
            , it will always only ever be the original target object or
            <code>undefined</code>
            when that target has been reclaimed.
          </li>
          <li>
            A
            <code>WeakRef</code>
            might never return
            <code>undefined</code>
            from
            <code>deref</code>
            , even if nothing strongly holds the target, because the garbage collector may never
            decide to reclaim the object.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3><code>WeakRef.prototype.deref()</code></h3>
        <p>
          Returns the WeakRef object's target object, or undefined if the target object has been
          reclaimed.
        </p>
        <h3>Using a WeakRef object</h3>
        <pre><code class="language-js">
class Counter {
  constructor(element) {
    // Remember a weak reference to the DOM element
    this.ref = new WeakRef(element);
    this.start();
  }

  start() {
    if (this.timer) {
      return;
    }

    this.count = 0;

    const tick = () => {
      // Get the element from the weak reference, if it still exists
      const element = this.ref.deref();
      if (element) {
        element.textContent = ++this.count;
      } else {
        // The element doesn't exist anymore
        console.log("The element is gone.");
        this.stop();
        this.ref = null;
      }
    };

    tick();
    this.timer = setInterval(tick, 1000);
  }

  stop() {
    if (this.timer) {
      clearInterval(this.timer);
      this.timer = 0;
    }
  }
}

const counter = new Counter(document.getElementById("counter"));
setTimeout(() => {
  document.getElementById("counter").remove();
}, 5000);
